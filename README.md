Welcome to my Sports Prediction Website, created with React-Redux. 

To proceed, run clone this repo as well as https://github.com/btagtow/sports-predictions-back, which has it's own Readme to follow. 

Run npm install followed by npm start (start it on a portal that is not localhost:3000 as this will be used for the backend). 

Proceed to the about section for instructions on using the app.
