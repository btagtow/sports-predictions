            <p>First, you will want to create an account. You will be given 100 betting points. 
                These are fictitious units with no monetary value. (But a heck of a lot of pride value!)</p>
            <p>Use your betting points to bet on your favorite sport! (Provided that sport is soccer, basketball, baseball, hockey, or football)</p>
            <p>Scroll over the "select league" dropdown at the top of this page and choose a league.</p>
            <p>Next, browse through the "Upcoming Games" in your selected league and choose a winner for any game in which you are confident about the outcome.</p>
            <p>After you select a game, the game will appear on the right side of the page. Here, choose the amount of betting points you'd like to spend.</p>
            <p>This is a <b>"NO ODDS CASINO"</b> meaning regardless of the point spread, if you win your bet you will win the amount of betting points you placed on that game.</p>
            <p>Finally, select your profile at the top of the page to see your submitted games and the points you bet on them.</p>
            <p>We get our sports data through a crowd-sourced database. Please be patient with the results.</p>
